<h2> CULTURE BEHIND BANKU</h2>

<p>Banku is a staple Ghanaian dish deeply rooted in culture, originating with the Ewe and Ga-Dangmepeople. Historically, it symbolized unity and togetherness, as its preparation was a communal activity.

<p>Unity and community: Preparing banku is often a collective effort that strengthens family and community bonds.</p>
<p>Heritage: The recipe has been passed down through generations, making it an integral part of Ghanaian heritage.</p>
<p>Cultural preservation: Using the name "banku" is considered important to preserve the culinary culture, as opposed to oversimplified terms like "corn swallow," </p>

<p>The term "banku" is derived from the Ga phrase "ba mi ku".
