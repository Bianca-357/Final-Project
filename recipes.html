    <h2> Jollof Rice Recipe </h2>
<img src="Images/Jollof.JPG" alt="Ghanaian Jollof Rice">
<ol>
    <li> 
      <strong> Prepare the blended base: </strong>
      In a blender, combine the chopped tomatoes, red bell pepper, onion, garlic, ginger, and Scotch bonnet peppers with ½ cup of water. Blend until smooth and set aside.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Cook the Stew Base: </strong>
      Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the thinly sliced onion and sauté until soft and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Fry the Tomato Paste and Seasonings:</strong> 
      Stir in the tomato paste and cook for another 3-5 minutes, stirring frequently, until it darkens in color and loses its raw, bitter taste. This is a crucial step for flavor development.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Simmer the Sauce:</strong> 
      Pour in the blended pepper mixture and stir to combine. Add the curry powder, thyme, crushed bouillon cubes, and bay leaves. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, reduces by about half, and oil starts to separate and rise to the surface (about 20-30 minutes).</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Add Rice and Stock:</strong>
       Add the thoroughly rinsed rice to the pot and stir well, making sure every grain is coated in the sauce. Pour in the stock (or water) and season with salt and pepper to taste. The liquid should just cover the rice.</li>

    <li> 
      <strong>Cook the Rice:</strong>
         Bring the mixture to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to the lowest setting. Cover the pot tightly with a layer of aluminum foil before placing the lid on top to trap the steam effectively.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Simmer and Rest:</strong>
       Simmer gently for about 30-40 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed. Do not stir too often to prevent the rice from becoming mushy. Check intermittently towards the end of cooking. If the rice is still hard but the liquid is gone, you can add a splash more water and continue steaming on very low heat.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Fluff and Serve:</strong> 
      Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the covered pot sit for 10 minutes. Remove the bay leaves and gently fluff the rice with a fork before serving.</li>

      <p>Ghana jollof is often served with sides like fried plantains, grilled chicken, or a fresh salad.</p>

    <ol>

    <h2> WAAKYE RECIPE</h2>
    <img src="Images/Waakye.JPG" alt="Rice And Beans" class="middle">
    <ol>
    <li> Prepare the Beans and Leaves</li>
    <li> Pick through the dried beans to remove any debris and wash them thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Soak the beans for a few hours or overnight to reduce cooking time and aid digestion. Drain the soaking water.</li>
    <li>Rinse the sorghum leaves and place them in a large pot with the washed beans.</li>
    <li> Add enough water to cover the beans and leaves, about 4-5 cups, and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>Add the baking soda (if using), which helps enhance the deep purple color from the leaves.</li>
    <li>Cook the Beans</li>
    <li> Reduce the heat and simmer until the beans are about halfway or three-quarters cooked, but not mushy. This usually takes around 30-40 minutes, depending on whether you soaked them.</li>
    <li> Add the Rice</li>
    <li>Remove the sorghum leaves from the pot.</li>
    <li> Rinse the rice well until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.</li>
    <li> Add the washed rice to the pot with the beans. Add salt to taste and more water if needed (the water level should be just enough to cook the rice).</li>
    <li> Stir the mixture well to combine the rice and beans evenly.</li>
    <li>Cook the Waakye</li>
    <li> Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to very low and cover the pot tightly (you can cover with aluminum foil or parchment paper before the lid to trap steam).</li>
    <li> Cook for about 20-30 minutes, stirring gently once or twice halfway through to prevent burning and ensure even cooking.</li>
    <li>Once the water has evaporated and the rice is tender but the grains are still separate, the waakye is ready. If the rice is still undercooked, add a splash more water and continue cooking on low heat.</li>
    <li>Stir in the optional coconut oil for a nice flavor and shine.</li>
